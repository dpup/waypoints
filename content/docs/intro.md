# Introduction to Waypoints

The development of engineering career frameworks has become a common challenge faced by growing technology organizations. As companies scale, they invariably find themselves needing to create structured paths for engineer growth and development.

While several prominent technology companies have publicly shared their internal leveling guides, these publications often lack the comprehensive detail needed for practical implementation. They frequently omit critical components such as deployment strategies, performance management processes, or compensation alignment. Furthermore, many existing frameworks focus heavily on technical knowledge and skills ("what you know") rather than the more crucial elements of autonomy, scope, and impact of work. This can lead to over-emphasis on technical abilities at the expense of measuring real business value and professional growth.

This pattern of companies independently developing career frameworks leads to significant duplication of effort across the industry. Moreover, it can result in inconsistent standards and expectations between organizations, making it difficult for engineers to navigate their careers across different companies. It also creates particular challenges for smaller companies and startups, which must invest considerable resources in developing these systems from scratch despite having more limited HR and management bandwidth.

## Purpose and Vision

This framework redefines what it means to be a modern software engineer by integrating technical excellence with product thinking. It provides a comprehensive structure for career development that emphasizes the creation of business value through technology while maintaining high standards of engineering craftsmanship.

The framework is designed to support organizations in developing engineers who are not merely code producers, but integral contributors to product success and business outcomes. It recognizes that in today's technology landscape, the most effective engineers combine deep technical expertise with a thorough understanding of user needs and business objectives.

## Framework Differentiation

This framework differs from traditional engineering leveling systems in several key ways:

1. It integrates product thinking and business impact at every level, rather than treating them as optional additions to technical skills
2. It emphasizes measuring success through business and user outcomes rather than purely technical achievements
3. It provides specific guidance for sustainable careers at the Senior Engineer level
4. It separates performance management into distinct processes for talent mapping and professional development
5. It maintains alignment with industry-standard compensation data while providing flexibility in implementation

To supplement point (3) the intention is to develop a series of Specialist Tracks which can be
pursued in addition to the Core and Manager Tracks.

## Ideal Implementation Context

This framework is particularly well-suited for early-stage startups and growing companies where engineers naturally wear multiple hats and maintain close proximity to business outcomes. It works especially well in organizations that emphasize rapid product iteration and value market feedback, as it encourages engineers to think beyond pure technical implementation.

Companies seeking to break down traditional silos between engineering and product teams will find the framework especially valuable, as it creates natural alignment between technical decisions and business impact. It's particularly effective for organizations wanting to build an engineering culture that promotes broad ownership and encourages engineers to think like product owners.

## Framework Components and Navigation

The framework consists of several interconnected components:

- Core track (L1-L6) detailing expectations and responsibilities
- Management track (M3-M6) with similar expectations and responsibilities
- Performance management processes
- Implementation and deployment guides
- Compensation structure recommendations

Each component is designed to work together while remaining flexible enough for adaptation.

## Customization and Adaptation

Organizations are encouraged to adapt this framework to their specific needs while maintaining its core principles. Customization might include:

- Incorporating company-specific values and cultural elements
- Adjusting level expectations based on organization size and stage
- Modifying implementation processes to match existing HR systems
- Adding or adjusting competencies based on technical stack or product focus

## Conclusion

This framework is intended to provide a structured approach to engineering career development that reflects the modern needs of technology organizations. By emphasizing both technical excellence and product thinking, it supports the development of well-rounded engineers who can drive significant business impact while maintaining high engineering standards.
