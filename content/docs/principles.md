6. **Iterative Improvement**: Embrace an agile mindset, focusing on delivering value incrementally and learning from user feedback.
7. **Technical Excellence**: Through clean code, thoughtful architecture, and rigorous development standards, build systems that other engineers can confidently understand, modify, and extend.
8. **Innovation Mindset**: Continuously seek ways to innovate and improve both the product and the development process.
