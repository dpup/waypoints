# Philosophy of Progression

Many engineering career frameworks focus heavily on technical knowledge, creating an incomplete picture of engineer growth. Through our own experience, and conversations with engineering leaders across the industry, we've found that frameworks emphasizing "what you know" often miss critical elements of engineer progression.

For instance, one framework we encountered defined staff-level engineers only through their deep technical knowledge, using analogies like "knows more about knots and rope-making than anyone else". While technical expertise matters, this narrow focus fails to capture how engineers work, what they achieve, and their broader impact on their organizations. The consequence of this approach is that seniority becomes non-transferable — an engineer's level becomes too tightly coupled to specific domain knowledge rather than their ability to create impact in varying contexts.

Waypoints therefore tries to take a more comprehensive view, grounded in established patterns of professional growth and skill development.

There are four foundational models which are worth calling out:

- The Dreyfus Model of Skill Acquisition, which describes how you progress from novice to expert
- PMI's Competency Framework, which outlines development across technical, performance, and interpersonal dimensions
- Bloom's Taxonomy, which maps cognitive development from basic understanding to creative mastery
- Kegan's Constructive Developmental Theory, which offers insight into how peoples' ways of making meaning evolve as they progress, from seeing their role in concrete, transactional terms to understanding more complex organizational and interpersonal dynamics

These theories help us develop a framework that follows natural development paths:

### Multiple Dimensions

Growth happens across multiple interconnected areas simultaneously. Technical capability progresses from following established patterns to developing intuitive mastery, while broader competencies in areas like communication and leadership naturally develop alongside technical skills.

### Evolving Mental Models

As people progress, they develop increasingly sophisticated ways of understanding and approaching problems. Junior engineers begin by learning and applying established patterns. As they advance, they develop deeper analytical capabilities, learn to evaluate trade-offs, and ultimately shape new technical directions for their organizations. This progression mirrors natural patterns of cognitive development.

### Deepening Context

Engineers develop expertise through increasingly nuanced understanding of how their work fits into broader contexts. New engineers focus on mastering fundamental skills through clear rules and procedures. As they progress, they develop deeper understanding of how technical decisions impact their teams, their users, and their businesses. At senior levels, this contextual understanding enables them to shape technical strategy and drive real outcomes.

### Expanding Scope

Engineers naturally expand their scope of influence as they progress. Technical scope grows from writing clean code to architecting complex systems. Organizational scope extends from working effectively on a team to driving alignment across multiple groups. Strategic scope evolves from implementing features effectively to shaping technical vision.

### Deepening Capability

Rather than simply accumulating new skills, successful engineers develop deeper mastery and craft — sometimes called being "T-shaped" or "π-shaped". This deepening mastery enables them to make better decisions faster, guide others in developing their own capabilities, but also makes it easier to acquire new skills.

### Growing Leadership

Technical leadership develops naturally alongside growing technical capability. The framework creates space for this evolution, from leading oneself effectively at junior levels to providing technical direction for teams and ultimately shaping technical culture across organizations. This leadership growth complements rather than replaces technical excellence, on both the core and manager tracks.

## Conclusion

By aligning with natural patterns of skill development while adapting them to the specific context of software engineering, we hope to create sustainable paths for growth that benefit both engineers and their organizations. Managers can use this understanding to better support their teams' development, while engineers can use it to better understand and guide their own career progression.
