# Company Size & Manager Levels

This addendum provides guidance on how manager levels typically map to roles in companies of different sizes. It's important to note that these mappings are general guidelines and may vary based on specific company structures, cultures, and needs.

## Startup (1-50 employees)

- M3 (Engineering Manager): Often titled "Lead Engineer" or "Tech Lead"
  - May still have significant individual contributor responsibilities
  - Likely reports directly to CTO or CEO
- M4 (Senior Engineering Manager): Typically the "Head of Engineering" or "VP of Engineering"
  - Often the most senior technical role, may be equivalent to non-founding CTO
  - Responsible for all engineering functions
- M5/M6 (Director/Senior Director): Usually not present
  - In rare cases, might be brought in as CTO for rapid scaling

## Small Company (51-200 employees)

- M3 (Engineering Manager): "Engineering Manager" or "Team Lead"
  - Manages a small team or a specific product area
- M4 (Senior Engineering Manager): "Senior Engineering Manager" or "Head of [Specific Area]"
  - Might lead backend, frontend, or a major product line
- M5 (Director): "Director of Engineering" or "Head of Engineering"
  - Often the top engineering role, reporting to CTO or CEO
- M6 (Senior Director): Typically not present
  - Might be brought in as CTO or VP Engineering for companies planning rapid growth

## Medium Company (201-1000 employees)

- M3 (Engineering Manager): "Engineering Manager"
  - Manages a team within a specific department or product area
- M4 (Senior Engineering Manager): "Senior Engineering Manager" or "Group Manager"
  - Might manage multiple teams or a significant product area
- M5 (Director): "Director of Engineering" for a major area
  - E.g., "Director of Frontend Engineering" or "Director of Platform Engineering"
- M6 (Senior Director): "Senior Director of Engineering" or "VP of Engineering"
  - Might be the top engineering role in smaller medium-sized companies

## Large Company (1000+ employees)

- M3 (Engineering Manager): "Engineering Manager"
  - Manages a team within a specific product or platform
- M4 (Senior Engineering Manager): "Senior Engineering Manager"
  - Manages larger teams or multiple smaller teams
- M5 (Director): "Director of Engineering" for a specific domain
  - E.g., "Director of Mobile Engineering" or "Director of Data Infrastructure"
- M6 (Senior Director): "Senior Director of Engineering" for a major division
  - E.g., "Senior Director of Consumer Products Engineering"

## Enterprise (10,000+ employees)

- M3 (Engineering Manager): "Engineering Manager" or "Senior Team Lead"
  - Manages a team within a specific product, platform, or department
- M4 (Senior Engineering Manager): "Senior Engineering Manager" or "Group Manager"
  - Manages multiple teams or a department within a larger division
- M5 (Director): "Director of Engineering" for a significant area
  - Might be responsible for an entire product line or major platform
- M6 (Senior Director): "Senior Director of Engineering"
  - Often responsible for multiple products or a major division
  - In some cases, might be equivalent to a C-level position in a smaller company

## Key Considerations

1. **Scope of Responsibility**: As company size increases, the scope of responsibility at each level tends to narrow but deepen. An M5 in a startup might be responsible for all of engineering, while an M5 in an enterprise might focus on a specific, complex domain.
2. **Reporting Structure**: In smaller companies, managers often report directly to C-level executives. As companies grow, additional layers are typically added.
3. **Individual Contribution**: In smaller companies, managers at all levels often maintain some level of individual contribution. This typically decreases as company size increases.
4. **Title Inflation**: Some companies, especially in competitive markets, may use inflated titles to attract talent. For example, a role that might be an M4 in a large company could be titled "VP of Engineering" in a smaller company.
5. **Growth Stage**: Fast-growing companies might create roles that anticipate future needs, leading to title structures more typical of larger companies.
6. **Industry Variations**: Some industries (e.g., finance, consulting) tend to have more conservative title structures, while others (e.g., tech startups) may be more liberal with senior titles.
