# Deploying a new Career Development Framework

Rolling out a new career development or leveling framework is fraught and can lead to significant disruption if done wrong. In our research we talked to companies who had taken 3 or 4 shots at getting it right, over the course of several years, and suffered morale and retention issues as a result.

Here we offer two approaches to rolling out the framework, one for when you are replacing an existing leveling system and another for when this is the first time a framework has been used. Both assume that people possess titles, since even when formal leveling isnâ€™t present, people are usually hired at levels based on previous roles and past experience.

## Starting Fresh (No Existing Framework)

Depending on the size of your team, the level of trust present, and accuracy of existing titles, this process can be accelerated. We offer a somewhat conservative process with the goal of minimizing upset and ensuring that the team remains focused on building.

_Ed Note: this process is currently described for rolling out the Core and Manager tracks. In the future this guide will be updated to include guidance on deploying the Specialist Tracks._

### Preparation Phase (4-6 weeks)

#### Team Formation and Framework Customization

- Establish a diverse working group including engineers across levels and managers
- Review and adapt level descriptions to align with organization's context
- Define clear boundaries between levels
- Create customized examples of behaviors and achievements at each level
- Document appeals process and identify decision makers

#### Documentation and Training

- Develop comprehensive rollout materials including:
  - Manager guidelines for level assessment
  - Expectation setting templates
  - Feedback and review process documentation
  - Growth and development planning frameworks
- Create manager training program with role-playing exercises
- Build communication strategy for engineering organization

#### Compensation Strategy

- Define compensation bands for each level
- Establish rules for handling compensation changes during transitions
- Create guidelines for managing exceptions
- Document promotion and adjustment processes

### Alignment Phase (4-6 weeks)

#### Initial Assessment

- Conduct manager calibration sessions
- Map current roles to framework levels based on capabilities
- Identify gaps between current and target levels
- Create preliminary transition plans

#### Framework Validation

- Consider pilot program with 1-2 teams
- Gather structured feedback on framework clarity
- Document edge cases and resolution approaches
- Refine materials based on initial feedback

### Transition Phase (3-6 months)

#### Individual Transitions

- Schedule 1:1 discussions with each engineer to:
  - Clarify level expectations
  - Set development goals
  - Establish growth timelines
- Create documented development plans:
  - For those meeting level expectations: focus on next-level growth
  - For those below expectations: create clear improvement plans with timelines

#### Support Structure

- Hold regular office hours for questions
- Provide manager support for difficult conversations
- Maintain feedback collection system
- Track common challenges and solutions

#### Evaluation

- Align with existing review cycles where possible
- Set clear promotion criteria
- Establish process for handling under-performance
- Document decisions and rationale

### 4. Stabilization Phase (3-6 months)

#### Ongoing Calibration

- Regular cross-team calibration sessions
- Documentation of level assessment examples
- Creation of case studies and success stories
- Development of additional support materials

#### Framework Evolution

- Collect and analyze framework effectiveness metrics
- Regular review and refinement of level descriptions
- Update documentation based on learned experience

## Starting Over (Migrating from Existing Framework)

Transitioning between frameworks requires additional care to maintain organizational stability and individual trust. The following process focuses on clear mapping between frameworks while maintaining momentum and minimizing disruption.

### Analysis Phase (4-6 weeks)

#### Framework Mapping

- Form working group including engineers and managers familiar with current framework
- Create detailed mapping between existing and Waypoints levels
- Identify gaps, overlaps, and potential challenges
- Document "before and after" scenarios for each current level
- Analyze compensation implications
- Identify potential retention risks

#### Impact Assessment

- Create impact analysis for each individual
- Identify cases requiring special attention:
  - Recent promotions
  - In-progress promotion cases
  - Performance improvement plans
  - Compensation edge cases
- Document grandfather clauses or special provisions needed

#### Calibration Exercise

- Run review process using both frameworks
- Document areas where mappings diverge
- Use insights to refine transition approach
- Update mapping documentation based on findings

### Preparation Phase (4-6 weeks)

#### Transition Planning

- Refine transition strategy based on calibration insights:
  - Updated timeline for framework switch
  - Revised communication strategy
  - Modified training requirements
  - Enhanced support structures
- Create comparison documentation highlighting:
  - What's staying the same
  - What's changing
  - Benefits of new framework

#### Manager Enablement

- Train managers on:
  - Framework differences
  - Transition conversations
  - Handling difficult questions
  - Managing anxiety and uncertainty
- Provide scripts and templates for common scenarios
- Create FAQ addressing likely concerns

### Cutover Phase (3-4 months)

#### Framework Switch

- Phase out old framework systematically:
  - Team by team or level by level
  - Clear cutover dates for each group
  - Documented transition plans for each individual
- Implement compensation adjustments if needed

#### Support and Monitoring

- Regular check-ins on transition progress
- Active monitoring of:
  - Team satisfaction
  - Framework adoption
  - Process adherence
  - Retention metrics
- Rapid response to emerging issues

### Stabilization Phase (3-6 months)

#### Continued Calibration

- Regular calibration sessions
- Creation of case studies to assist managers
- Refinement of processes

#### Cultural Integration

- Promote framework language and concepts
- Share success stories
- Document learned experiences
