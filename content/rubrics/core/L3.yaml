level: L3
title: Software Engineer
description: |
  L3 engineers are hitting their stride. They're the reliable workhorses of the
  team, consistently delivering high-quality work. They're not just implementing
  features; they're actively involved in shaping them, bringing their technical
  expertise to product discussions. They're often the go-to person for specific
  areas of the codebase and are adept at balancing technical debt with feature
  delivery. They're also emerging as mentors, helping to guide and develop more
  junior team members.

responsibilities:
- Owns small to medium-sized projects or features
- Proactively considers user needs and business impact in technical decisions
- Architects scalable and maintainable solutions for complex problems
- Mentors junior engineers and contributes to their growth
- Actively participates in product discussions, offering technical insights
- Drives improvements in development processes and tooling
- Demonstrates strong debugging and problem-solving skills

expectations:
  technical:
    exceeds: Architects scalable and maintainable solutions for complex problems, proactively addressing potential issues. Balances technical debt and feature delivery with minimal supervision.
    meets: Designs scalable, maintainable, and well-architected solutions for complex problems. Delivers well-documented, high-quality code with minimal supervision.
    misses: Struggles with architecting scalable solutions and balancing technical debt with feature delivery. Often requires significant oversight from more senior engineers.

  ownership:
    exceeds: Owns and delivers small to medium-sized projects or features, balancing technical debt with feature delivery. Communicates progress and risks to stakeholders consistently.
    meets: Manages and delivers small to medium-sized projects independently, coordinating with cross-functional teams and ensuring that project goals align with business needs. Proactively resolves issues as they arise.
    misses: Struggles to manage small to medium-sized projects independently, requires significant oversight, and often fails to balance priorities effectively.

  impact:
    exceeds: Balances technical decisions with user needs and business impact, frequently suggesting optimizations that improve product or operational efficiency.
    meets: Proactively considers user needs and business impact when making technical decisions; contributes to product discussions with thoughtful business-related insights.
    misses: Rarely considers the business impact of their technical decisions; focuses mostly on short-term feature delivery without considering long-term product outcomes.

  collaboration:
    exceeds: Collaborates well with team members; communicates technical details effectively; creates accurate tech specs or RFCs to support their work.
    meets: Works effectively across teams, fostering strong working relationships; communicates complex technical ideas clearly and concisely; produces clear and comprehensive documentation.
    misses: Struggles with effective communication or collaboration; tech specs or RFcs are often incomplete or unclear, leading to misunderstandings or knowledge gaps.

  support:
    exceeds: Mentors junior engineers on technical basics and team practices. Provides feedback in code reviews and actively participates in interviews or hiring discussions.
    meets: Provides regular mentorship to junior engineers and peers, helping them grow. Actively participates in interviewing and hiring processes, offering valuable input.
    misses: Limited engagement in mentorship. Struggles to provide effective guidance or feedback. Rarely participates in the interview process or offers little value when involved.

  leadership:
    exceeds: Takes ownership of improving team processes and suggests small changes that improve productivity. Manages their own work effectively and contributes to team discussions.
    meets: Suggests and leads small team process improvements. Takes initiative in team discussions around workflow, tooling, and practices. Demonstrates self-leadership and supports team effectiveness.
    misses: Struggles to manage their own work independently or suggest improvements to team processes. Fails to contribute meaningfully to team discussions about workflows or tooling.

traits:
- Deliver small to medium-sized projects independently, making sure theyâ€™re scalable and well-maintained.
- Provide thoughtful, constructive feedback during code reviews and helps guide junior engineers.
- Write comprehensive documentation that covers technical decisions, trade-offs, and implementation details.
- Actively participate in product discussions, offering technical insights that help shape the direction of features.
- Take on mentorship roles, helping junior engineers learn best practices and navigate complex problems.
- Balance technical debt and feature delivery, ensuring both short-term wins and long-term stability.
- Are a go-to person for specific areas of the codebase, helping the team understand and navigate those parts.
- Actively contribute to improving team processes and tooling, suggesting ways to enhance efficiency.
- Demonstrate strong debugging skills, resolving issues quickly and helping others troubleshoot as needed.
- Consistently deliver high-quality work on time and clearly communicates progress and challenges to stakeholders.

management:
  goal: |
    The primary goal when managing L3 engineers is empowering them to be strong,
    independent technical contributors while helping them develop the skills to
    drive larger initiatives and to juggle multiple concurrent workstreams.

  tips:
  - Grant significant autonomy in technical decision-making while remaining available as a sounding board
  - Create opportunities for them to influence product strategy and technical architecture
  - Encourage them to develop and document technical standards and best practices
  - Help them balance individual contribution with mentoring responsibilities
  - Support them in building relationships across the organization

  areas:
  - Technical influence
  - Project planning and risk management
  - System design and architecture decisions
  - Cross-functional communication and collaboration
  - Strategic thinking and business alignment
  - Technical debt management and trade-off decisions

  measurement:
  - Evaluate the success of projects they lead, not just their individual contributions
  - Assess the quality and impact of their technical decisions
  - Track their influence on team practices and standards
  - Observe their effectiveness in product and architectural discussions

  pitfalls:
  - Treating them solely as senior individual contributors
  - Not providing enough exposure to strategic decisions
  - Failing to develop their leadership and influence skills
  - Overwhelming them with too many mentoring responsibilities
  - Not challenging them with complex enough technical problems
