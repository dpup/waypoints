  Senior engineers are becoming the technical leaders of their teams. They're
  not just building features; they're shaping the technical direction of
  projects and influencing product strategy. They have a holistic view of the
  system and can anticipate future challenges. They're adept at navigating
  complex technical and non-technical challenges, often acting as a bridge
  between engineering and other departments. Their focus extends beyond their
  team, looking for ways to improve engineering practices across the organization.

management:
  goal: |
    The primary goal when managing senior engineers is to amplify their influence
    while helping them navigate the increased complexity of technical leadership.
    Success at this level is measured not just by their technical output, but by
    their ability to drive organizational change and mentor others.

  tips:
    - Position them as technical leaders with real decision-making authority
    - Include them in strategic planning and roadmap discussions
    - Create opportunities for cross-team and cross-functional leadership
    - Trust their technical judgment while helping them understand business context
    - Support them in developing and executing their technical vision
    - Help them balance technical leadership with hands-on development

  areas:
    - Strategic technical planning and vision setting
    - Stakeholder management and influence
    - Technical program management
    - Team building and leadership
    - Cross-functional collaboration
    - Business and product strategy alignment
    - Technical risk assessment and mitigation

  measurement:
    - Success of initiatives they lead
    - Adoption of technical practices they champion
    - Growth and performance of teams they influence
    - Impact of their architectural decisions
    - Effectiveness of their cross-functional partnerships
    - Quality of their strategic technical planning

  pitfalls:
    - Limiting their influence to purely technical decisions
