# Waypoints — A SWE Career Development Framework

Software engineering is constantly evolving. However, even as AI is transforming how code gets written, the fundamental traits that make great engineers – problem-solving, system thinking, and product sensibility – are just as important as ever.

Waypoints is an open source career development framework that emphasizes the scope and impact of engineering work, encouraging teams to think more holistically about how their technical decisions drive business value. It provides clear guidance for both individual contributors and engineering managers, with level descriptions that reflect the changing nature of software development while reinforcing timeless engineering principles.

Use the framework as-is, or fork it and customize it for your team's needs.

## Overview

This framework addresses common challenges in engineering career development by providing:

- Clear level definitions and rubrics from L1 (entry level) through L6 (principal)
- Parallel tracks for individual contributors and managers
- Detailed expectations across multiple dimensions for each level
- Practical management guidance for supporting engineer growth
- Implementation guidelines

In a future version we plan to introduce the concept of "Specialist Tracks" which allow for diverse and individualized career paths.
