    <h1>Core Track</h1>
    <p>
      The core track represents the level of autonomy an individual has, and their impact on the
      organization. It is expected that most people continue to progress through the levels until
      they reach L4, however, at that point many individuals may diversify their skills and
      experience instead of seeking to progress to L5 or switching to the manager track.
